# Revisionist Etymology
<p class="subtitle">by Ewoud & Joeri</p>

## ☞ What do you need to play
* 3 or more people
* Things to write on, like post-its or 3-by-5's.
* Things to write with.
* Optionally: a fun accessory for the linguist to wear

## ☞ How to play
1. Appoint someone as the linguist for this round.
2. The linguist picks a word or phrase, which the others each write down on a piece of paper.
3. The other players then make up the etymology of that word or phrase and write it down. They fold up their work and hand it to the linguist.
4. The linguist shuffles the submissions and reads each of them aloud.
5. Then it's time to pick a new etymology for the chosen word or phrase. How an etymology is judged is up to you. The whole group can discuss which etymology they find best, but in the end, the linguist has the final say.
6. The winning etymology **becomes your new truth** and you are encouraged to use it anywhere in life you see fit. The author of the winning etymology receives 1 point and the next round starts.

When someone has earned 3 points, they win the game and get to decide what the group does next.
